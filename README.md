# StartUp-Investments-Analysis
The pipeline consists of three major Python scripts:

1. Data Cleaning Script â€“ investment anylsis report data cleaningg.py
This script loads the raw data (investments_VC.csv), cleans it, and saves a cleaned version as cleaned_investments!.csv.
What it does:

Fixes column names (e.g., lowercase, no spaces)

Converts strings like '1,000,000' into numeric format

Extracts year from date columns

Handles missing values, renames columns

Creates useful features like primary_category, founded_year, etc.

2. EDA + Visualization Script â€“ investment anylsis report data visualazation.py
This script reads the cleaned data and creates static charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Visuals include:

Total funding amounts

Most active startup categories

Trends in funding over years

Pie chart of startup status (e.g., operating, acquired)

Correlation between funding and number of funding rounds

ðŸ“Š This is your exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase â€” understanding the story behind the numbers.


3. Streamlit Dashboard â€“ SIAapp.py
This script is a fully interactive web dashboard built using Streamlit.
Users can:

View top funded startups

Explore funding trends and categories

Interact with filters (e.g., Top N countries or companies)

Use visual tools like pie charts, boxplots, and heatmaps

This dashboard reads the cleaned_investments!.csv file and offers a user-friendly interface for exploring the insights youâ€™ve generated.
